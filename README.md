## Gun Death in the U.S. (2012 - 2014) Project with Excel, SQL and Power BI

This project explores the patterns and trends of gun deaths in the United States between 2012 and 2014 using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The analysis includes data cleaning and transformation in SQL, detailed statistical analysis in Excel, and interactive visualizations in Power BI. 
The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to gun deaths and support data-driven discussions on this critical issue.

### Project Objectives:

The primary goal of this project is to analyse gun death data in the United States from 2012 to 2014 to uncover significant trends, patterns, and insights. Specific objectives include:

Analyse Causes of Death:
Investigate the various causes of gun deaths, such as suicides, homicides, accidents, and undetermined causes.
Compare the prevalence of each cause to understand their impact over the three-year period.

Examine Age Groups:
Identify the age distribution of deceased individuals.
Determine which age groups are most affected by gun deaths and explore potential reasons for these trends.

Assess the Impact of Education Level:
Analyse the education levels of the deceased to see if there is any correlation between education and gun death rates.
Explore whether certain education levels are more vulnerable to gun deaths.

Gender Analysis:
Compare gun death statistics between males and females.
Investigate any significant gender-based differences in gun death causes and trends.

Place of Death Analysis:
Examine the locations where gun deaths occurred, such as at home, on the streets, in public places, etc.
Identify patterns and trends related to the places of death.

Race and Ethnicity:
Examine the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the deceased.
Identify any disparities in gun death rates among different racial and ethnic groups.

Monthly Trends:
Analyse the data to find out which months had the highest number of gun deaths.
Look for any seasonal patterns or anomalies in the data.

Yearly Trends:
Track gun death trends over the three years to identify any significant increases or decreases.
Investigate factors that might have contributed to these yearly trends.

Visualisation and Reporting:
Create interactive dashboards and visualisations using Power BI to present findings in an accessible manner.
Use visual storytelling to effectively communicate complex data insights to a broader audience.

By achieving these objectives, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing gun deaths in the U.S. and contribute to informed discussions on this critical issue.
